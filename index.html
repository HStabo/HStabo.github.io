    especially light on a sensitive surface </p>

    <h1>The earliest idea of photography </h1>
    <p>Or: projected images onto another surface</p>
  </hgroup>
  <p>
    The first camera obscura used a pinhole in a tent to project an image from outside the tent into the darkened area. It was not until the 17th century , specifically in 1685, that German author Johann Zahn envisioned a prototype design for the camera obscura that was small enough to be portable.The images were also upside down, though they could be traced to create accurate drawings of real objects such as buildings.

    <h1>Inventors </h1>
    <p>Or: Fathers of photography </p>
  </hgroup>
  <p>
    Joseph Nicéphore Niépce and Louis Daguerre are often considered the inventors of photography with cameras, as we now know it. The former started out experimenting with silver chloride and silver halide photography, but could not figure out how to prevent them from darkening when exposed to light.
    In 1826, Niépce succeeded in taking the first true camera photograph. He used a sheet of pewter coated with bitumen, which required an exposure time of at least 8 hours! The subject of this photograph hit close to home for Niépce; the view from his workroom in Saint-Loup-de-Varennes, France. The Niépce Heliograph is considered as the earliest known photograph in the history of photography, achieved with the aid of the camera obscura.
    Painter Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre was so excited about this achievement that he decided to partner with Niépce. Daguerre continued to develop, refine and tinker with the process by using silver-plated copper sheets and mercury vapor. As he continued to develop this process, Daguerre was able to vastly reduce the exposure time.

  <h1>Quick Imagies </h1>
  <p> <strong>Polaroid</strong>  </p>
</hgroup>
<p>
  The Polaroid camera, also known as Model 95, made its debut in 1948, created by inventor Edwin H. Land. The instant photograph became a huge hit thanks to a chemical 
  process used to develop film inside the camera in less than a minute.
</p>


<h1>The beginning of SLR </h1>
  <p>Although the SLR (single lens reflex) camera has its beginnings in Europe in the 1890s and into the 1940s (along the same time that color film was invented by Agfa), the technology didn't become truly viable until the 1950s </p>

<h1>  Photography Fun Facts </h1>

<ul>
    <li> The word “Photography” comes from the Greek, meaning to draw with light. The earliest known use of the word photograph as we know it was in 1839 by the astronomer Sir John Herschel.</li>
    <li>Some of the most popular subjects of photography in the 1800s were corpses. Many famous individuals were famously photographed after their deaths </li>
    <li>The chemicals used in the development of photographs included mercury, silver nitrate, lye, and more. These chemicals were extremely dangerous and many photographers had to take time off from their work due to illness caused by exposure to the chemicals  </li>
