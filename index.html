    especially light on a sensitive surface </p>

    <h1>The earliest idea of photography </h1>
    <p>Or: projected images onto another surface</p>
  </hgroup>
  <p>
    The first camera obscura used a pinhole in a tent to project an image from outside the tent into the darkened area. It was not until the 17th century , specifically in 1685, that German author Johann Zahn envisioned a prototype design for the camera obscura that was small enough to be portable.The images were also upside down, though they could be traced to create accurate drawings of real objects such as buildings.

    Joseph Nicéphore Niépce and Louis Daguerre are often considered the inventors of photography with cameras, as we now know it. The former started out experimenting with silver chloride and silver halide photography, but could not figure out how to prevent them from darkening when exposed to light.
    In 1826, Niépce succeeded in taking the first true camera photograph. He used a sheet of pewter coated with bitumen, which required an exposure time of at least 8 hours! The subject of this photograph hit close to home for Niépce; the view from his workroom in Saint-Loup-de-Varennes, France. The Niépce Heliograph is considered as the earliest known photograph in the history of photography, achieved with the aid of the camera obscura.
    Painter Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre was so excited about this achievement that he decided to partner with Niépce. Daguerre continued to develop, refine and tinker with the process by using silver-plated copper sheets and mercury vapor. As he continued to develop this process, Daguerre was able to vastly reduce the exposure time.
