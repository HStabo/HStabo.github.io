            <p style="background-color:rgb(170, 146, 228);">Who Invented The First Camera?

              The first portable camera was designed by Johann Zahn in 1685. Not much progress was made in the development for up to approximately 130 years later. Most of the attempts to make cameras in between were futile. It was not until the year 1814 when Joseph Nicephore Niepce clicked the first photograph. The credit for the invention of the first camera is therefore co-shared between Johann Zahn and Joseph Nicephore Niepce. The photo taken by Nicephore was not permanent. It was taken using a camera he made on his own, on a paper coated with silver chloride. The regions that were not exposed to light on the paper became dark.
              
              Louis Daguerre is given the credits for inventing the first ever practical photography in 1829. It took Daquerre over a decade attempting to come up with an effective method for the photography. All the progress Daquerre made was in partnership with the Nicephore. The ownership rights were sold to the French Government, which in turn took the responsibility of developing daquerreo type studios in different parts of the country. Alexander Walcott invented the first camera that produced photos that did not fade quickly.</p>
