          The first camera obscura used a pinhole in a tent to project an image
          from outside the tent into the darkened area. It was not until the
          17th century , specifically in 1685, that German author Johann Zahn
          envisioned a prototype design for the camera obscura that was small
          enough to be portable.The images were also upside down, though they
          could be traced to create accurate drawings of real objects such as
          buildings.

        <h2>Inventors</h2>
        <p>Or: Fathers of photography</p>
        <p class="background-color2">
          Joseph Nicéphore Niépce and Louis Daguerre are often considered the
          inventors of photography with cameras, as we now know it. The former
          started out experimenting with silver chloride and silver halide
          photography, but could not figure out how to prevent them from
          darkening when exposed to light. In 1826, Niépce succeeded in taking
          the first true camera photograph. He used a sheet of pewter coated
          with bitumen, which required an exposure time of at least 8 hours! The
          subject of this photograph hit close to home for Niépce; the view from
          his workroom in Saint-Loup-de-Varennes, France. The Niépce Heliograph
          is considered as the earliest known photograph in the history of
          photography, achieved with the aid of the camera obscura. Painter
          Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre was so excited about this achievement
          that he decided to partner with Niépce. Daguerre continued to develop,
          refine and tinker with the process by using silver-plated copper
          sheets and mercury vapor. As he continued to develop this process,
          Daguerre was able to vastly reduce the exposure time.

          The Polaroid camera, also known as Model 95, made its debut in 1948,
          created by inventor Edwin H. Land. The instant photograph became a
          huge hit thanks to a chemical process used to develop film inside the
          camera in less than a minute.

          film was invented by Agfa), the technology didn't become truly viable

        <h2>Photography Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The word “Photography” comes from the Greek, meaning to draw with
            light. The earliest known use of the word photograph as we know it
            was in 1839 by the astronomer Sir John Herschel.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some of the most popular subjects of photography in the 1800s were
            corpses. Many famous individuals were famously photographed after
            their deaths
          </li>
          <li>
            The chemicals used in the development of photographs included
            mercury, silver nitrate, lye, and more. These chemicals were
            extremely dangerous and many photographers had to take time off from
            their work due to illness caused by exposure to the chemicals
